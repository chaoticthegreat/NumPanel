## Inspiration
I wanted to create a macropad that allowed me to input things into the calculator quickly with layers, sicne my current keyboard does not have a numpad. 

## Challenges
This was my first time using KiCad and Fusion so I had to learn how to use both of those tools. The PCB wiring in KiCad was kinda hard since it was my first time and I made a lot of mistakes. Assembling the case together in fusion was also hard since I had to learn about how mates work.
